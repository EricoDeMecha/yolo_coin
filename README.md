## COIN DETECTION AND SORTING
This is coin detection and sorting using deep neural net (OpenCVDNN).
I have already implemented one using YOLOV3 for the pi. Yolo models trained with kenya's currency custom
dataset will soon be available.
There are also plans to use SSD MobileNet to compare speeds and pick the best.

### Project Setup
1. High Video Frames Capture.

- Pi: I have used RaspividYUV for video frames capturing
- PC : I am currently working on cross-platform multithreaded video frames capturing.
